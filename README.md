# labProtocol
structure, procedure, expectations for working on projects

## What for
First: to orient others to my workflow on experimental projects in LCNL. Second: to make explicit the roles and expectations of any collaborations on these projects - primarily between RAs and myself, but as a starting point for other collaborators. Third: to document and develop LCNL procedures
