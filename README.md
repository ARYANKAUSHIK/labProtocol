# labProtocol
## What
structure, procedure, expectations for working on projects
1. Folders and readme files (above) show how I organize my projects.
2. [Documentation](../../wiki) explains philosophy, expectations and goals for task management, experimentation and analysis in the context of being a Research Assistant in the [Language and Cognitive Neuroscience Lab](http://lcnl.wisc.edu).

## What for
1. to orient others to my workflow on experimental projects in LCNL. 
2. to make explicit the roles and expectations of any collaborations on these projects - primarily between RAs and myself, but as a starting point for other collaborators. 
3. to document and develop LCNL procedures
