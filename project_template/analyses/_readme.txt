# Analyses, which tied to certain data, I believe are closer to communicating the data than to the experiment.
# Additionally, having analyses done in one place reduces issues of reanalysis happening in a range of local places, when
# there may be cases where centralizing them is good.
# Analyses are closer tied to products, though somewhat independent.
