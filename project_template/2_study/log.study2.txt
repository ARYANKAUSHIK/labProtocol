This file contains all experimental development, modifications, and outcomes concerning only this local study. See logs in other study folders for respective information. See parent folder's 'products' folder for any and all edited presentations of these studies. This file is divided into two major sections. The first provides a snapshot of the experiment including summary statements, the second provides progress for each experimental phase in chronological order. Details for each are in their respective sections.


# SNAPSHOT #
###################################################################################

# TABLE: Each major phase of the experiment should be completed in chronological order, with few exceptions. Ideally, the conclusion of one phase is the start of the next. In the rare cases that experiments are modified while ongoing, unique subfolders for development and experiment should be made, changes fully detailed here. (eg. Dev.p5, Dev.pX, Exp.p5, Exp.pX)

# SUMMARY: This is a descriptive summary of the state of each phase of the experiment. 
Important notes for closed loop phases, or reminders for open-loop phases are described 
here. These descriptions should ultimately look like publication sections, or directions 
to quickly generate them.

# Initiation #
General description before work begins. Not required. 

The previous study looked at X. We found X1. For this study we're hoping that X will let us 
do/see/conclude Y.

# Development #
Description of how materials and design were developed.

We developed stimuli with X variation, and Y control. We did this by using B software which 
gave us J outcome. We tried A method, but got K outcome. We developed counterbalance Z1-factors 
within and Z2-factors between subjects, randomized for Z3-factors.

# Experiment #
Description of experimental procedure, and runtime considerations.

We used software E on F1 computers with F2 specialized equipment (audio, microphone, etc.). 
Participants did G,H,I. These J things related to experiment presentation, went wrong n times. 
They were (not) changed. If they were changed, we opened a new experiment and/or development 
folder (added throughout all documentation including here).

# Data #
Description of observed raw and coded data (add coding section if needed; see readme).

Unlike about experiment implementation, this is about observations made during the experiment. 
Number of participants. We have n = observation X (missing n = reason j, n = reason k); n = 
observation Y (same thing). Raw data points of interest were consolidated into a .csv file 
manually. The coding scheme for the raw data file structure is below.

# Analysis #
From raw and coded data to analysis outputs, we used excel to transform X, python to filter Y, and r to analyze Z.

csv from raw data underwent the following basic transformations.
